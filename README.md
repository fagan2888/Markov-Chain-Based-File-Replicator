# MarkovChainBasedFileReplicator
An implemented a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton to replicate various literary works where our program 
output is based on stochastic production laws designed according to chain frequencies within any given text 
file. The Nondeterministic Finite Automaton, based on Markov chain production rules can be interpreted as a 
context free grammar and can be easily altered into a Context Sensitive Grammar for various applications or 
improvement in certain areas.
